# community-detection
The NMF algorithm is implemented based on Gradient Descent and results are compared with sklearn's default package implementation. Then, the NMF decomposition is used for clustering purposes. Assuming X is a dataset, if we apply NMF on it and get X=WH, W would be the cluster centers and H would be the coefficients for each data point in the clustering. As an example, topic modelling is chosen and topics from a number of documents in the 20 News groups dataset are extracted. NMF is applied to do the clustering and give the topics.A community detection problem on Zacharyâ€™s karate club Graph dataset from the Networkx package is also defined, and communities are detected using NMF.
